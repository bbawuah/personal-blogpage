<h2>XR Testing</h2>

<p>At the end of our first sprint we came up with a prototype that we could test with others. We created two environments were the user could perform some tasks.</p>

<p>The first environment is the concentration test. In this environment, the user needs to focus on an object that moves around the environment. The environment is suppose the give the user a comfortable feeling.</p>

<p>What we wanted to test in this environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the plane too fast?</li>
</ul>

<p>The other environment is a cinema where we test the stress level of the user. More and more people get added to the room. the user needs to stay in the room until he/she doesn't feel comfortable anymore.</p>

<p>The general questions we asked</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>How do they feel after completing the experience?</li>
<li>Is the spawn rate too fast?</li>
<li>If you could change one thing about the prototype, what would it be?</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>What kind of guidance is needed to complete the scenarios?</li>
<li>If we were to present some questions, would you prefer to have them in an user interface or on a simulated “screen”?</li>
<li>Is the interaction with the menu user friendly?</li>
<li>Does the experience provide enough feedback to the user?</li>
<li>What alternative ways of interaction would you consider to add to the project?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does the Interaction work as expected?</li>
<li>Do you get enough feedback for your actions / interaction?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The results we got after the tests gave us a lot of insights. We came to the realization that it was difficult to create a solid sotryline for the concept. At this point, the environments were just seperate scenes. There was no storyline or clear goal for the user. These were things we had to think about.</p>
