<h2>XR Concepting & Design</h2>

<p>
When a client from Specialisten net starts a procudure, they need to fill in a form. This form gives the therapist more information about the person and it gives an indication about whether the user is having any mental health issues. Our goal is to create a VR experience were we translate the questionaires into immersive VR experiences
</p>

<p>
For this sprint we wanted to see if we can actually translate some of the questions into good looking VR experience.
We created and concentration environment and a focus environment.
</p>

<p>
After the tests we received some feedback about our concept. The goal for the user was not clear enough. After the feedback, we had some good brainstorm sessions about our concept.
</p>

<p>
We came up with a new concept where there is a clear story for the user.
</p>

<p>
The user starts in a dark environment. This environment can be a forest for example. The dark environment should illustrate the dark place a person with depression is living in.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the game is to get out of that dark environment. If the user stays too long in the dark environment, A game over event would get triggered. To out of this environment, the user needs to follow a path in the forest.
</p>

<p>
On his way out of the forest, the user will cross some obstacles that it needs to overcome. These obstacles illustrate the little steps a person with depression takes to get out of that dark place.
</p>

<p>
After every obstacle the user gets rewarded for his accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
We are still continuing to develope our concept. But this is what we have for now. We integrated the feedback that we received on monday and spend time defining our concept.
</p>

<h3>Personal side project<h3/>

<p>I also continued working on the concept of my personal project. The idea is that I want to close the gap between creatives in my environment and emerging technologies. I want to create an immersive gallery that showcases creatives and talents. The goal is to inspire creatives and talents to express themselves in innovative ways with technologies.
</p>

<p>
The experience will be an Augmented reality experience for mobile devices. There will also be an virtual reality experience available if you enter the website on your vr headset. The regular experience will be a immersive 3D experience web. The reason I am building this on the web is because the internet is accesible to everyone. And I want to reach as many people as possible.
</p>

<p>
The environment will be an museum. I chose this environment because people usually go to museum to get inspired. This is the same feeling I am trying to create. Minimalistic, a lot of light and bright colors and some good sound.
</p>

<p>To challenge myself, I started the concepting for this side project as well. I wanted to implement the things that I was learning in the minor on a side-project that I am very passionate about.</p>
