<h2>XR Assets</h2>

<p>For our first sprint we had to create assets for our test scenes.</p>

<p>As we wanted to create some objects for in a room. I created a soccer, a closet and a paper plane. All objects were made out of one object by using loop cuts and extruding faces until I reached the result that I liked.</p>

<h3>Individual project</h3>
<p>
As mastering Blender is something that is on my learning goals. I player around with some modifiers and I focused on spending more time on finding efficient ways to build beatifull looking models. 
I found a way to create beauftiful textures for my models called <em>baking</em> which I will explain and demonstrate later in this article.
</p>

<h4>Array modifier</h4>
<p>For my museum I wanted to create some stairs so that the user would be able to explore the second floor. I found out that to create some stairs in blender, the array modifier is the perfect tool for that.</p>

<p>I started of with the first step, and the array modifier could copy that object an x amount of time and translate the coordinates for every object. That is perfect to create some stairs because every step you could change the coordinates to place the next step a little bit higher than the previous one.</p>

<p>Once you are done with your modifier, you should not forget to "apply" the modifier to your object. If you don't do this, the copies of your object will not exist.</p>

<h4>Baking</h4>
<p>Baking is a basically a technic that you can use to literally bake the texture from a render on an image, that you apply to your model in a game engine or in another environment of your preference.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate how I have used this baking technic for my 3D/VR experience on the web.</p>

<h5>UV Unwrapping</h5>
<p>To apply any kind of texture, it is essential to start of uv-unwrapping your model. In Blender, there is a cool option</p>

<p>I asked 25 people if wanted to participate and result is looking really nice!</p>
