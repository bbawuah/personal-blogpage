<h2>XR Assets</h2>

<p>The second week of the pressure cooker, we had to create our own VR experience</p>

<h3>Individual project</h3>
<p>
For my individual project I wanted to create all the assets by my self. As mastering Blender is something that is on my learning goals, I tried to focus on this and spend more time on finding efficient ways to build beatifull models
</p>

<p>Creating the basket was a bit difficult but I think the result looks pretty good. Blender has some nice modifiers that made it easier to create the basket</p>

<h3>Personal side project<h3/>

<p>For my personal project I have finished the 3D model that I will use as my environment.</p>

<p>To optimize my model, I exprimented with baking textures into materials which turned out really nice</p>
