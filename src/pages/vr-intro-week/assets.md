<h2>XR Assets</h2>

<p>The second week of the pressure cooker, we had to create our own VR experience</p>

<h3>Individual project</h3>
<p>
For my individual project I wanted to create all the assets by my self. As mastering Blender is something that is on my learning goals, I tried to focus on this and spend more time on finding efficient ways to build beatifull models
</p>

<p>Creating the basket was a bit difficult but I think the result looks pretty good. Blender has some nice modifiers that made it easier to create the basket</p>

<p>I also created some balls to play, which were not that difficult to make</p>

<h3>Personal side project<h3/>

<p>For my personal project I wanted to build a museum in Blender. Because I want to use this model on the web, it needs to be as optimized as much as possible to give the user a good experience </p>

<p>I spend a lot of time working on a 3D museum for my personal project</p>
