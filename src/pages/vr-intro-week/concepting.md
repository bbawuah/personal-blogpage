<h2>XR Concepting & Design</h2>

<h3>Group project</h3>
<p>
We started our week with a group assignment. We had to do some research about a global world problem and think about a way how we can create a VR solution for this problem.
We came up with the idea to create a solution for marine pollution. This was a topic that touched all of us so we were driven to create a nice VR concept for this problem
</p>

<p>
After our brainstorm sessions we came up with the idea to create a VR game where the user is a sea turtle who is swimming in a polluted ocean. The goal of the game is to survive in a polluted environment but the game gets harder over time. It will get more and more difficult to swim in the ocean and to keep dodging the plastic nets and bags.
</p>

<h3>Individual project</h3>
<p>I really like the idea of using vr to play sports at home</p>
<p>
For my individual project I came up with the idea to create a basketball game. The goal of this game is to give the an enjoyable and realistic experience during the game. 
</p>

<h3>Personal side project<h3/>
<p>This week I got inspired to create a personal side project. I saw a very cool website called. <a href="https://shutdown.gallery/" target="__blank">shutdown.gallery</a> which is a AR experience on the web where they showcase art pieces. I wanted to create a similar experience not for art but to showcase creatives and talents of Amsterdam. </p>

<p>To challenge myself, I started the concepting for this side project as well. I wanted to implement the things that I was learning in the minor on a side-project that I am very passionate about.</p>
