<h2>Development</h2>

<p>This sprint I have not done any development for our group project. But I have been experimenting with writing some shaders to get familiar</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have learned some new tools and technics that I have not translated in our project yet, but were really usefull for my learning process! I could use these technics later in the semester in our group project.</p>
